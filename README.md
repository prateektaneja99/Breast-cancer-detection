# Breast-cancer-detection
Dataset -  BreakHis

Files and uses
model.py - Txt file that has the model . One can train the model with the dataset mentioned to get an accuracy of 90.4%. 
Model is a tinny version of VGG16 that is tuned to get the best possible accuracy.

Augmentation.py - Randomly augments images to equalise the number of images in each category.

app.py - A sample flask app to deploy the model on the localhost with web as it's front end

others - Related to the flask file

To do:
- Run the augmentation.py to generate augmented images
- Merge the augmented images into the original image folders
- Train the model.py with the data set
- Run the app.py file
- Run the local host to find the prediction of an uploaded image



Contributions are welcome!.
